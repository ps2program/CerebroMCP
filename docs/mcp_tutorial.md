## What is MCP?

Think of MCP as a USB-C port for your AI applications. Just as USB-C offers a standardized way to connect devices to various accessories, MCP standardizes how your AI apps connect to different data sources and tools.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a powerful framework that enables:
- Standardized communication between AI applications and tools
- Dynamic capability discovery and adaptation
- Flexible integration of various AI models and resources
- Seamless tool and resource management

## Core Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture with three key components:

### 1. Host
The host represents any AI application (like Claude desktop, Cursor) that:
- Provides an environment for AI interactions
- Accesses tools and data
- Runs the MCP Client

### 2. MCP Client
The client operates within the host to:
- Enable communication with MCP servers
- Discover server capabilities
- Adapt to server changes dynamically

### 3. MCP Server
The server exposes specific capabilities and provides access to:
- **Tools**: Enable LLMs to perform actions
- **Resources**: Expose data and content
- **Prompts**: Create reusable prompt templates and workflows

## Communication Flow

### 1. Capability Exchange
```python
# Server capability definition
@stdio_server()
async def server_capabilities() -> dict:
    return {
        "tools": ["weather", "calculator", "database"],
        "resources": ["documents", "api_keys"],
        "prompts": ["analysis", "summary", "qa"]
    }
```

### 2. Dynamic Adaptation
Unlike traditional APIs, MCP allows for dynamic capability updates:
```python
# Client-side capability handling
async def handle_server_capabilities(server):
    capabilities = await server.get_capabilities()
    # Client automatically adapts to new capabilities
    if "new_tool" in capabilities["tools"]:
        await setup_new_tool()
```

## Implementation in CerebroMCP

### 1. Server Setup
```python
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

@stdio_server()
async def persistent_handler(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Server exposes its capabilities
    capabilities = {
        "tools": ["llm", "rag", "crewai"],
        "resources": ["memory", "documents"],
        "prompts": ["analysis", "research"]
    }
    return await process_with_capabilities(prompt, capabilities)
```

### 2. Client Integration
```python
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

async def create_adaptive_client():
    client = await ClientSession.create(
        server=StdioServerParameters(command=["python", "app/servers/persistent_server.py"]),
        name="adaptive-client"
    )
    # Client discovers and adapts to server capabilities
    await client.discover_capabilities()
    return client
```

## Key Advantages Over Traditional APIs

1. **Dynamic Capability Discovery**
   - Servers can add new capabilities without breaking clients
   - Clients automatically adapt to new features
   - No need for version updates or code changes

2. **Flexible Integration**
   - Easy addition of new tools and resources
   - Seamless integration of different AI models
   - Support for various data sources

3. **Standardized Communication**
   - Consistent interface across different servers
   - Unified way to access tools and resources
   - Simplified integration process

## Best Practices

### 1. Capability Management
```python
async def manage_capabilities(server):
    # Regularly check for capability updates
    while True:
        new_capabilities = await server.get_capabilities()
        await update_client_capabilities(new_capabilities)
        await asyncio.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
async def safe_capability_use(client, capability: str, params: dict):
    try:
        if capability in client.available_capabilities:
            return await client.use_capability(capability, params)
        else:
            return await fallback_capability(params)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Capability error: {e}")
        return await handle_capability_error(e)
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Tool Integration
```python
@tool_capability
async def weather_tool(location: str, date: str) -> dict:
    # Tool implementation
    return await get_weather_data(location, date)
```

### 2. Resource Management
```python
@resource_capability
async def document_resource(query: str) -> str:
    # Resource access implementation
    return await search_documents(query)
```

### 3. Prompt Templates
```python
@prompt_capability
async def analysis_prompt(context: str) -> str:
    # Prompt template implementation
    return f"Analyze the following: {context}"
```

## Security and Performance

### 1. Capability Validation
- Validate all capability requests
- Implement capability-specific access control
- Monitor capability usage

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently used capabilities
- Implement capability-specific rate limiting
- Monitor capability performance
