# Model Control Protocol (MCP) Tutorial
![MCP Architecture](../../static/img/mcp-architecture.gif)

## Introduction

The Model Control Protocol (MCP) is a powerful framework for orchestrating AI models and managing their interactions. This tutorial will guide you through the core concepts, implementation details, and best practices for working with MCP.

## Core Architecture

MCP is built on a modular architecture that consists of several key components:

1. **Model Registry**: A central repository for managing AI models and their capabilities
2. **Task Orchestrator**: Coordinates the execution of tasks across multiple models
3. **Context Manager**: Maintains conversation history and context
4. **Protocol Handler**: Manages communication between components

## Communication Flow

The typical communication flow in an MCP system follows these steps:

1. Client sends a request to the MCP server
2. Task Orchestrator analyzes the request and determines required models
3. Context Manager retrieves relevant context
4. Models process the request in sequence or parallel
5. Results are aggregated and returned to the client

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Model Registration

```python
from mcp import ModelRegistry

registry = ModelRegistry()
registry.register_model(
    name="gpt-4",
    capabilities=["text-generation", "code-completion"],
    max_tokens=8192
)
```

### Task Orchestration

```python
from mcp import TaskOrchestrator

orchestrator = TaskOrchestrator(registry)
result = orchestrator.execute_task(
    task_type="code-generation",
    input_data={"prompt": "Create a Python function to sort a list"},
    required_capabilities=["code-completion"]
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose models based on specific capabilities needed
   - Consider token limits and cost implications
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

2. **Context Management**
   - Maintain relevant conversation history
   - Implement context pruning for long conversations
   - Use context compression when necessary

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error recovery
   - Log all model interactions
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache frequently used model responses
   - Implement parallel processing where possible
   - Monitor and optimize token usage

## Advanced Features

### Custom Model Integration

```python
from mcp import BaseModel

class CustomModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.capabilities = ["custom-task"]
    
    async def process(self, input_data):
        # Custom processing logic
        return result
```

### Context Management

```python
from mcp import ContextManager

context_manager = ContextManager()
context_manager.add_context(
    conversation_id="conv_123",
    context={"user_input": "Previous message"},
    max_history=10
)
```

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Scaling**
   - Implement load balancing
   - Use connection pooling
   - Monitor resource usage

2. **Security**
   - Implement authentication
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Rate limit requests

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track model performance
   - Monitor error rates
   - Set up alerts

## Conclusion

MCP provides a robust framework for building sophisticated AI applications. By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create scalable and maintainable AI systems that effectively leverage multiple models.
